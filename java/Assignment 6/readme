1. Write a Java program using try and catch to generate Array Index Out
of Bound Exception and Arithmetic Exception.


2. Write a class that keeps a running total of all characters passed to it

(one at a time) and throws an exception if it is passed a non-
alphabetic character.


3. Write a program that takes a value at the command line for which
factorial is to be computed. The program must convert the string to
its integer equivalent. There are three possible user input errors that
can prevent the program from executing normally.
● The first error is when the user provides no argument while
executing the program and an
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is raised. You must write a
catch block for this.
● The second error is NumberFormatException that is raised in
case the user provides a non-integer (float double) value at the
command line.
● The third error is IllegalArgumentException. This needs to be
thrown manually if the value at the command line is 0.



4. Create a user-defined exception named CheckArgument to check the
number of arguments passed through the command line. If the
number of arguments is less than 5, throw the
CheckArgumentexception, else print the addition of all the five
numbers.



5. Write a java program to create a custom Exception that would handle
at least 2 kinds of Arithmetic Exceptions while calculating a given
equation (e.g. X+Y*(P/Q)Z-I).
